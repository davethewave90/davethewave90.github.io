<h2>Profiles</h2>
<h4>Daniel Hurtz - 22 years old - male</h4>
<p>Daniel is an avid fisherman who spends most of his free time on the weekends fishing his local ponds.</p>
<h4>Katie Allred - 17 years old - female</h4>
<p>Katie is looking to get back into her favorite sport of soccer. This is after taking a year off from recovering from a knee
surgery.</p>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>Katie has been approved by the doctor to resume practice. But, only when the weather permits. She can't play if the air is cold
or the grass is wet. So, it is imperative she have the most accurate weather report possible.</p>
<p>Daniel wants a functional
weather report site to know which, when and where the best times to go fishing are.</p>
<p>Martha Stout is a releif society president who is often tasked with planning ward parties. She would of course need a reliable
site where she can check the weather for the best times.</p>
<p>Alan Christensen is a fishing guide who makes his living taking people out to the local rivers. He makes his living off planning
and preparing outdoor trips. He relies on an accurate weather site every day of his life.</p>
<p>Matthew Bowen is a father of several young children. He simply wants to know when is the best time to plan outdoor trips from
simply going to the park to weekend camping trips.</p><br>
