    <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
    <h3>Netflix:</h3>

    <p>
      Netflix immediately draws the eyes to the importance of Netflix. They want you to see right away that they have
      unlimited streaming. You also see this principle exemplified in their textbox input. They use visual hierarchy to show you the
      why of Netflix, and how you can sign up. The font starts very large, becomes smaller with lesser details to get you to sign
      up, then becomes very large again in its attempt to become immediately apparent on just how to do so.

    <h2>White Space</h2>
    <h3>Google:</h3>
    <img alt="google" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/109f08f3-7a09-4571-8816-1e34944cf96b%2Fgoogle.png?v=1610854508266">
    <p>
      What better example of utilizing white space effectively than good ol' Google? Google is arguably the most popular and
      most visited webpage in the entire world. But, as one can clearly see not only does Google not feel the need to saturate
      its main page with an abundance of features, it seems to portray a downright disdain for it. Clean, professional, easy-to-use, 
      these are some of the words that come to mind when anyone thinks about Google's homepage.

    <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
    <h3>Amazon</h3>
    <img alt="amazon" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/109f08f3-7a09-4571-8816-1e34944cf96b%2Famazon.png?v=1610856950858">
    <p>
      Amazon is easily one of the most recognizable and successful companies in world. There are a great many reasons for this, but
      one good reason is their exemplary website. They are first and foremost an online shopping website after all. For a good example
      in contrast you have to look no further than Amazon. Between their fonts, colors, menus, images and more - Amazon knows exactly
      how to show the best content that keeps you on their site and shopping longer.
