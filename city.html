	<span class="indents">One</span><span> thing that many know and think about when they think about Utah is the high population of members of The Church of Jesus
	Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Also Known as Mormons. What may be unknown is just how high the density of said members is within Mapleton.
	It is estimated that over 93% of Mapletonians are members of the Church. If you are a member of this Church, Mapleton can bring a sense
	of community hard to find in many of our nation's cities. If not, do not worry. All people in Mapleton are known for being friendly and
	tolerant of all people and their beliefs. The interesting fact is just how many "Mormon" churches there are in Mapleton alone. While
	there are no temples in Mapleton, there are more than a dozen churches in Mapleton and the surroundng city of Springville.</span>
